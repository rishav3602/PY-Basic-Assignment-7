16. What is the procedure for making a normal expression in regax case insensitive?
"""

"""
Answer...

To make a regular expression case-insensitive in most programming languages, you can use a flag or modifier that indicates this behavior.

In Python, we can use the re.IGNORECASE flag as a second argument to the re.compile() function.
