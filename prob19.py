19. What does passing re.VERBOSE as the 2nd argument to re.compile() allow to do?
"""

"""
Answer...
Passing re.VERBOSE as the second argument to re.compile() allows you to write a regular 
expression in a more readable and organized way by ignoring whitespace and comments.


Normally, white space and comments are ignored in a regular expression, which makes it
difficult to visually parse and understand. By using re.VERBOSE, you can add whitespace 
and comments to the regular expression, making it easier to read and understand.
